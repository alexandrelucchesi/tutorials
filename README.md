# Mavins Tutorials

This repository centralizes the source codes of all of our tutorials.

## How is it organized?

The files from each tutorial go inside separate folders, which are named after
the tutorial's title. For instance, code for "Projetando Algoritmos por Indução"
should be in the folder "projetando-algoritmos-por-inducao".

## How to collaborate?

If you published a tutorial on [Mavins Blog](https://mavins.com.br/blog/), just
submit a PR with the related files (mind the previous topic) and add your name
to the section below (in case it's not there yet).
